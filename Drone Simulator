In collaboration with the Aeronautical Department of MIT, weâ€™ve created an engaging and immersive experience inspired by the
DJI Phantom 4 for accurate design and assembly details. 
Players can assemble the drone using a non-linear system, and a training course to train novice people enhancing the interactive
 experience. 

Modeled modular drone components in Blender including propellers, camera mount, body frame, and remote controller.
